Quick Workflow

Start debugging: <F5>
Add watch: <Leader>dw and type your expression
Evaluate current word: Put cursor on variable and press <Leader>de
Evaluate selection: Select text and press <Leader>de
Step through code: <F10> and watch your expressions update

DAP UI Navigation
In the watches panel:
a - Add new watch
d - Delete watch

You have several ways to close the terminal:

  From within the terminal (in insert mode):
  - Type exit and press Enter
  - Press Ctrl+d (sends EOF to close the shell)

  From terminal mode (press Esc first to exit insert mode):
  - Press <leader>t (your existing toggleterm keybind)
  - Use :q or :bd to close the buffer

  From anywhere in Neovim:
  - Press <leader>t (toggles the last terminal on/off)

  Window navigation:
  - Ctrl+w w - Switch between windows
  - Ctrl+w q - Close current window (if focused on terminal)

  The easiest way:
  Just press <leader>t from anywhere - it will toggle the
  terminal closed. If you run another Python file with
  <leader><cr>, it will reuse the same terminal or create a new
  one as needed.

  Pro tip: You can also use Ctrl+\ Ctrl+n while in the terminal
  to quickly exit insert mode without closing the terminal, then
  navigate back to your code.

> how do i clear the terminal

‚óè You can clear the terminal in several ways:

  Standard terminal commands:
  - Type clear and press Enter
  - Press Ctrl+l (most common shortcut)

  From terminal insert mode:
  - Ctrl+l - Clears screen immediately
  - Type clear + Enter - Clears screen and command history

  From terminal normal mode (press Esc first):
  - Ctrl+l still works
  - Or type :!clear + Enter

  The fastest way:
  Just press Ctrl+l while in the terminal - this is the universal
   terminal clear shortcut that works in most shells (bash, zsh,
  fish, etc.).

  Note: clear only clears the visible screen but keeps the
  scrollback history. If you want to completely wipe the terminal
   history, you might need shell-specific commands like:
  - reset - Full terminal reset
  - clear && printf '\e[3J' - Clear screen and scrollback buffer

  For most cases, Ctrl+l is what you want - quick, easy, and
  universal.

  Window Navigation (General):
  - Ctrl+w h - Move to left panel
  - Ctrl+w j - Move to bottom panel
  - Ctrl+w k - Move to top panel
  - Ctrl+w l - Move to right panel
  - Ctrl+w w - Cycle through all windows
  - Ctrl+w p - Go to previous window

  DAP-specific Navigation:
  When debugging with DAP UI open:
  - Navigate to debug panels (breakpoints,
  scopes, watches) using Ctrl+w + direction
  - Click on panels to focus them
  - Use <Leader>du to toggle the entire DAP UI

  Buffer Navigation (Your current keymaps):
  - Tab - Next buffer (BufferLineCycleNext)
  - Shift+Tab - Previous buffer
  (BufferLineCyclePrev)
  - <Leader>1, <Leader>2 - Jump to specific
  buffer numbers

  Terminal Navigation:
  - Ctrl+\ Ctrl+n - Exit terminal insert mode
  (then you can navigate away)
  - <Leader>t - Toggle terminal on/off

  Quick Panel Switching:
  - <Leader>e - Toggle file tree (NvimTree)
  - <Leader>dr - Open DAP REPL
  - <Leader>du - Toggle DAP UI

  Pro tip: The fastest way is usually Ctrl+w w
  to cycle through all open windows, or Ctrl+w
  + arrow keys for directional movement.
